# Wordle-Solver
This project uses statistical evaluations to calculate the best words for the word game "Wordle" given the hints so far.

This program is the same as "Wordle" but the opposite. Instead of the computer having a secret word and you trying to guess it, the computer is the one who is guessing, and it uses some statistics to evaluate the best guess.
